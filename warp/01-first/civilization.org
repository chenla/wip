** Scope
** TL;DR


*** nomenclature, etymology



*** civilization <-> Barbarism

Civilization as in opposition Barbarism is a conceit -- so-called
barbaric societies are rich complex systems that share pretty much all
of the traits of a civilization save, a sedantary lifestyle, man made
buildings and settlements, cultivated monoculture of domesticated
species of plants and animals.  These have always been portrayed as
being in opposition, with one being superior to the other -- but this
is a value judgement that has survived because of writing systems,
without any record of what life was like on the other side.  In fact,
civlization is, in large part, the story of the subjegation of nomadic
peoples by sedantary societies and power structures.  The Mongolian
Empire was the great exception, and proved that nomadic systems could
embody all of the so-called positive characteristics of sedantary
civilization while still being semi-nomadic.

*** singular plural

The plural and the singular

humanity is converging and becoming a single civilization.  For all
practical purposes it already is.

*** cop out -- complex societies

The rejection of the term civilization in favor of the term /complex
societies/ is not satisfactory as it reduces humanity as a whole to a
complex system -- which is what it is, but not that it is something
unique among all animal societies and is far greater than the sum of
it's parts.

As such, we will call what we are building, simply, /the culture/ as
used by Iain Banks, as both the material way of life and
infrastructure, together with the normative principles, values and
ideals of a culture.

*** the clean and well-lit prison

clash of civilization -- narrow definition of a subset of culture as
religion or ideology.

the whole clash of civilizations rubbish.

*** Techne and MÄ“tis

Material life, technology -- settlements, buildings, agriculture,
writing, mathematics, tools, economic and social structures.

*** Culture

way of life, normative principles, values and ideals.


*** Mankind

Originally collective homo sapiens, Sapians -- if we broaden our scope
and context we should include all of Man which includes all of our
fellow subspecies of Man.  This is important because the concept of
Man is more inclusive, that encompasses what we are and what we will
become.

Our nature, our imperitive is to extend and externalize our mind,
memory and muscle.  Because of that we must include other species
other than our fellow Men to include domesticated species who are part
of us, dog, cat, chicken, horse, pig, cow.  The list is short.


*** Usage

Our usage in W&W will be:

  - Civilizations : usage before 1900 when there were multiple
    civilizations.  Each had it's own sustainible material and
    economic system, each had their own culture.  There were multiple
    such systems
